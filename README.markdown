Alibaba Kernel is originated by [Alibaba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group), the largest e-commerce website in Asia. It is based on RHEL6 source codes and included some updates and new features need by Alibaba.
For more information and documentation, please refer to
http://kernel.taobao.org

This repo includes everything you need to build a rpm successfully, but it may not be friendly to the kernel developers since there is no code, but a list of patches, in this repo. So If you want to see the kernel development and every detail we do in Alibaba, please refer to
https://github.com/alibaba/ali_kernel.

And what's more, since it is used to build rpms and have to be stable, this repo may not be updated frequently like we do in github.com/alibaba/ali_kernel. The rpm you build and installed from repo is almost the same as what we have used now in the production system.

Please refer to rpm/README about how to build the rpm successfully.
master is the rpm for RHEL5/CentOS5 users, if you are RHEL6/CentOS6 users, please use branch 6u.
